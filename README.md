# Introduction
LCVis (Light Curve Visualization) is a visualization tool for light curve analysis in astronomy.

# Run the demo
This project is just a website. Firstly, please clone the repo to your disk. Then download and unzip the light curve data [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/20z0gf9cacx3zbt/data.zip?dl=0) and put the `data/` folder in `./static`. 

Secondly, install `Flask`. You can do so by `pip install flask`.

Then go to the root directory and type `python main.py`. 

Finally, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` for periodic astro-objects and `http://localhost:5000/supernova` for supernova.
