# Introduction
LCVis (Light Curve Visualization) is a visualization tool for light curve analysis in astronomy.

# Run the demo
This project is just a website. Firstly, please clone the repo to your disk. Then download and unzip the light curve data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwrNxLqCfaB5bE00SndqMjFJckk/view?usp=sharing) and put the `data_ogle/` folder in `./static`. 

Secondly, install `Flask`. You can do so by `pip install flask`.

Then go to the root directory of the repo and type `python main.py`. 

Finally, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` for periodic astro-objects.
(*Notice* it takes about 30 seconds to load the data)
